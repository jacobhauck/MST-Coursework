\title{Math 5601 Independent Study Project Proposal}
\author{Jacob Hauck}


\begin{document}
	\maketitle
	
	For my independent study project in Math 5601, I plan to study the \verb*|maxvol| algorithm for computing the CUR decomposition of a matrix \cite{goreinov_2010}.
	
	I will attempt to fulfill two goals for this project.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item I will explain in my own words the theoretical estimates provided in \cite{goreinov_2010}.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item For this part, I will read the paper and rewrite the important definitions and proofs with more explanation, details and commentary.
		\end{enumerate}
		\item I will create a NumPy implementation of the \verb*|maxvol| algorithm as it is described in \cite{goreinov_2010}.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item First, I will create my own pseudocode description of the algorithm based on the theoretical understanding gained from the first part of the project.
			\item Second, I will convert the pseudocode into actual Python code, implementing matrices using NumPy.
			\item Third, I will test the algorithm on random matrices (following \cite{goreinov_2010}) to validate that it is correct and that the method is effective.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
